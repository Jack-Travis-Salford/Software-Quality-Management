Salford University Year 3 - Software Quality Management. 


This is the writeup I submitted for the 3rd year module, SQM, at Salford University. 

The context of a given company was given, stating their experience in their specilized industry, building information systems for the healthcare industry. 

We were told that the company is considering implementing a Software Reuse approach to their development process. 

The given task was to investgate the use of Software Reuse for information systems in the healthcare sector, using recent publications and literature, with a focus on empirical studies.

These resources were then to be used to write a technical report, discussing the pros and cons of using Software Reuse in the given industry, before concluding the suggested course of action the company should take.
